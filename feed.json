Conflict is not something to be avoided because it allows one to move forward and anger, annoyance, insults and so on do not allow one to move forward in this conflict. People who cannot control themselves and communicate will behave in a contradictory way when resolving conflict. We have experimented to accompany conflicts.</p>\n<h3><strong>Solution</strong></h3>\n<p class=\"p1\">Feel is an application that allows you to control your tensions and anticipate conflict situations in order to improve community life. When the smart bracelet detects that your nerves are on the verge of exploding through your heartbeat, it manifests itself by producing pressure on your wrist and invites you to consult your application. The base with the talking ball activates when it detects that a conflict is breaking out. It invites users to take the talking ball with them in order to continue the confrontation. The ball connected to the bracelet follows the principles of the talking stick to accompany communication.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--full\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://lucas-bms.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/19/ecosytem_Service0.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2561\" height=\"1601\"></figure>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--full\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://lucas-bms.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/19/ecosytem_Service1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1600\"></figure>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--full\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://lucas-bms.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/19/ecosytem_Service2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1600\"></figure>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--full\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://lucas-bms.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/19/ecosytem_Service3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1600\"></figure>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--full\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://lucas-bms.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/19/ecosytem_Service4.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1600\"></figure>\n<h3><strong>Process</strong></h3>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://lucas-bms.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/19/process-feel-en.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1601\" height=\"265\"></figure>\n<p> </p>\n<h3>Idéation</h3>\n<p class=\"p1\">Based on the theme, we started by brainstorming to find and link themes.

When a compelling moment occurs, the smart bracelet detects arm movements and pulse, and from a threshold emits a first vibration on the wrist to inform that anger is rising. At the end of the second stressing event, another wrist contraction is sent. Finally, if the tone rises again between the individuals, the base locates the argument and starts flashing to make the individual take the ball and handle it. It becomes the talking stick to accompany the participants.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">We diversified our media, from cardboard prototypes, sketches to visual models and I designed 3D prototypes.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--wide\" ><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://lucas-bms.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/19/3D-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1602\" height=\"560\">\n<figcaption >3d of the base.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://lucas-bms.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/19/ecosytem_Service1-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2560\" height=\"1600\"></figure>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://lucas-bms.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/19/photo-2-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1069\" height=\"827\"></figure>\n<figure class=\"post__video\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/XUXSlI2SDLg\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\" data-mce-fragment=\"1\"></iframe></figure>\n<h1> </h1>\n<h2 class=\"align-center\"><span style=\"color: #fc9561;\">Conclusion</span></h2>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"p1\">This project has taught me a design approach experimenting from the very beginning of the design process by prototyping objects, doing to think, experiencing experiences and emotions differently, far from design thinking.

For 18 hours, we designed and prototyped service concepts through mobile applications in order to clarify the service offer provided by the Métropole's Trabool and Toodego services.</p>\n<h3 class=\"p2\"><strong>Problem</strong></h3>\n<p class=\"p1\">The digital services offered to users of the Lyon metropolitan area are geared towards the use of Toodego for administrative procedures and the Trabool service for mobility in transport and cultural offers. These services are built in a silo, because the current and future roadmaps are not known and shared with the whole team, which leads to proposals of sometimes similar services: bus timetables, service proposals, same partners. Following feedback from partners and users, expressing their lack of understanding of the services, the project managers decided to find a solution by organising a sprint design. The design agency Nod-A was commissioned to set up the workshop. Project manager Erwan Leluron invited the in-house designers at the Métropole, Alexandra Douine and myself, to accompany him. Our role was to design the organisation of the sprint with the agency's designers.</p>\n<p class=\"msg msg--highlight \">Sprint design is an innovative workshop method based on problem-solving through experimentation, modelling and rapid idea-hypothesis testing over 5 days with very little means.</p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><strong>Processus</strong></h3>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://lucas-bms.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/18/processus-design-sprint-en.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1470\" height=\"294\"></figure>\n<h2> </h2>\n<h2 class=\"align-center\"><span style=\"color: #fc9561;\"><strong>1. </strong><strong>Preparation of the sprint</strong></span></h2>\n<p> </p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><strong>Setting objectives</strong></h3>\n<p class=\"p2\">Together with the internet team, we set the objectives upstream and downstream of the project during co-creation sessions. We set ourselves the goal of :</p>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li3\">improving and clarifying value propositions and service offers ;</li>\n<li class=\"li3\">help partner users to better differentiate services and make journeys between them more fluid (switching from one service to another);</li>\n<li class=\"li3\">communicate clearly about the services proposed ;</li>\n<li class=\"li3\">have a common vision.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><strong>Identifying the problem</strong></h3>\n<p class=\"p2\">The sprint takes place over two days, so the issue was chosen during meetings with the project managers, the manager, the designers and the sprint design agency. Various issues that the project teams of the Trabool and Toodego departments came up with, such as :</p>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li3\">The service offering of the products is not known or shared by all project managers and project teams;</li>\n<li class=\"li3\">The services offer some similar functionalities ;</li>\n<li class=\"li3\">The BtoB offer: the partners do not always understand the link between the different services (and receive several requests from project managers);</li>\n<li class=\"li3\">The BtoC offer: users get lost in the services (example: there is the same offer for Velo<span class=\"s1\">'</span>v).</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><strong>4 possible scenarios</strong></h3>\n<p class=\"p2\">Four hypotheses of scenarios have been put forward to determine the scope of the solution that the ideation will lead to. These scenarios represent whether the services should merge completely, on certain services or no longer cover the same services.</p>\n<ol class=\"ol1\">\n<li class=\"li3\">Merger of the two services.</li>\n<li class=\"li3\">Dividing the services in two.</li>\n<li class=\"li3\">One product sucks certain services from the other.</li>\n<li class=\"li3\">Total separation of services.</li>\n</ol>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://lucas-bms.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/18/hypotheses.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"807\" height=\"142\"></figure>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><strong>Organising the project</strong></h3>\n<p class=\"p2\">For the preparation of the sprint, the design agency was in charge of designing the tools of the workshop (persona, course, canvas) and Alexandra and myself were in charge of making the ecosystem of current services as well as the business model. Other meetings were held in order to clarify the problems and to develop the workshop that Nod-A proposed to us.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\" ><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://lucas-bms.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/18/ecosysteme.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"887\" height=\"751\">\n<figcaption >Ecosystem of different internal projects.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><strong>Value proposition of services</strong></h3>\n<p class=\"p1\">Before the sprint, I proposed to draw up a business model and value proposition for each department concerned with the project managers (Toodego, Trabool, Only'moov, Grand Lyon Connect) in order to identify possible repetitions or subjects to be clarified. They will then be presented to the participants during the sprint.</p>\n<p class=\"msg msg--highlight \">The value proposition design and business model serve to identify the value created by a product or service that customers need and benefit from.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">I therefore organised workshops with the project managers for the development of new service proposals.

Alexandra and I, in-house designers, were shared in each team in order to bring a design point of view and content to the follow-up of the projects we have.</p>\n<h3 class=\"p3\"><strong>Start with the system analysis </strong></h3>\n<p class=\"p1\">After a presentation of the services business model, each team was asked to link similar information and areas of overlap found in other business models in order to identify duplications, but also to identify unclear elements. We were able to see common partners, services and information (e.g. air quality, traffic information) and common functionalities (each service includes a dashboard). The value propositions have similarities for Toodego and Trabool, and are no less to be specified.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\" ><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://lucas-bms.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/18/ecosysteme-recouvrement.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"600\">\n<figcaption >\n<p class=\"p1\">Business model canvas and overlapping areas.</p>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The teams also noted all the interactions between the products in order to add \"points of suffering\" maps that identify questions about the ecosystem, duplication and misunderstanding of services. </p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\" ><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://lucas-bms.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/18/ecosysteme-services.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"4132\" height=\"2663\">\n<figcaption >Product ecosystem and friction points.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><strong>Creating new user journey</strong></h3>\n<p class=\"p1\">The identification of ecosystem irritants and similarities in the business models served as a basis for creating user routes with the help of persona, according to the hypotheses of project scenarios (merging, sharing, aspiration, separation).

class=\"p1\"><strong>Final presentation</strong></h3>\n<p class=\"p2\">In order to present the solutions we have found and to envisage the continuation after the sprint, we pitched the prototypes to the service director and final decision-maker of the sprint. The feedback he has been able to give is about the separation of the services and the silencing of the solutions. He thinks that the services should not be separated, but crossed so that the users move from one service to the other and are in daily use.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 class=\"align-center\"><span style=\"color: #fc9561;\"><strong>3. After the sprint</strong></span></h2>\n<p> </p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><strong>Analysis of returns</strong></h3>\n<p class=\"p2\">Despite this, what can we do? The bulk of the work was done over two days thanks to the collective intelligence and expertise of each person, creating a lot of material to build on, which had to be reworked and discussed with a cold mind. Moreover, the important thing in sprint design is also to test the prototypes in order to evaluate the user feedback and above all to validate or invalidate the hypotheses with prototypes. At this stage, we don't know if the ideas can lead to real service.</p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><strong>Team sharing</strong></h3>\n<p class=\"p2\">We then organised meetings with the project managers to discuss the solutions implemented and the follow-up and with the decision-makers in order to have a strategic vision. This process would end with tests or experiments with a panel of experienced users.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://lucas-bms.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/18/photo-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"533\"></figure>\n<p class=\"p1\">In the end, however, decision-makers will choose not to go for one of the solutions imagined. They were not satisfied with the results and preferred to continue as they had left, although there were inconsistencies and overlaps in services. We could not go through the whole process and test the ideas.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">From there, we still held meetings with the directors and decision-makers in order to collect the positive and negative opinions of each service proposal, but also the strategies and objectives of the Metropolis and the role that the projects should have. We used the meetings to bring out the rules of obligations, constraints and wishes in relation to the service.</p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><strong>Creation of a \"project kit</strong></h3>\n<p class=\"p2\">We have designed project sheets for project managers to orient themselves according to the strategy of the Metropolis, listing the mandatory and desirable rules of the services.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://lucas-bms.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/18/kit-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"566\"></figure>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://lucas-bms.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/18/kit-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"566\"></figure>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://lucas-bms.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/18/kit-3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"270\"></figure>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 class=\"align-center\"><span style=\"color: #fc9561;\"><strong>Conclusion</strong></span></h2>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The workshop allowed me to insist on elements of the service to be clarified. It also allowed me to affirm the role of design and in-house designers. I was able to propose tools for analysing services and bring the expertise I had acquired on projects during the year during the sprint. This bubble of imagination created by the workshop and collective intelligence gives a group dynamic trying to find a common solution to the problems it encounters. The continuation of the workshop is a crucial moment, because it is necessary to be able to take up the elements conceived during the workshop to continue well the continuation. Even if the project has not yet come to fruition, I had the opportunity to set up a design approach at the source of the problem and to point it out. The decision-making process is very complex and we are still struggling to get information from the field back to the decision-makers.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">This project was the end of my journey within the Metropolis and showed me the complexity of implementing projects for users, as well as the lack of testing and the brakes on institutional change. This project combining social problems, political communication and the interest of the partners reinforced my belief that we should have integrated the final decision-makers further upstream in the design process. Finally, the Metropolis has been enriched with a design culture thanks to this project, even though I expected much more and the sprint did not lead to an imagined solution, but served to improve project practice.</p>",

In this context, our work consists of supporting public policies by drawing up prospective scenarios for the development of residential and professional mobility on the scale of the conurbation and neighbouring villages.</p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><strong>Problem</strong></h3>\n<p class=\"p2\">In this rural area, public transport is less advantageous than the car, especially for commuting, and the needs of users are decentralised throughout the area. In comparison, the car allows greater flexibility and independence in this environment and is the number one choice for getting around. The conurbation finds itself polluted by car use and must therefore rethink mobility for trips between villages, home-to-work journeys and review its public transport system in order to move towards more responsible behaviour.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p class=\"p2\"><strong>How can we think of a sustainable and flexible transport service offer taking into account the rural environment in the Val de Garonne in order to limit the use of the private car?</strong></p>\n</blockquote>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><strong>Solution</strong></h3>\n<p class=\"p2\">Our research phase has shown us the interest in deepening them and the need to engage in a reflection with users. We have identified the need to educate both elected representatives and citizens on mobility issues. This should be done with citizens in order to change their habits and make them responsible in terms of sustainable mobility.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\">We designed a process of citizen participation, through debate and workshops, to collect, inform and include citizens in the responses for local implementation. This process is based on the creation of a fictitious universe through the use of design fiction, into which the inhabitants and elected representatives of the Val de Garonne will project themselves. It aims to challenge assumptions and imagine the future of mobility.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Design fiction to project yourself into a probable future</strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">To believe in fiction, we have used design fiction to involve citizens and elected officials in projecting themselves into a probable future in order to question the present.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://lucas-bms.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/16/1-solution.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"258\" height=\"500\"></figure>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>What if... you can no longer drive alone?</strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">In order to believe in fiction and to immerse users in fiction, we have designed various devices (website, flyers and video) that take up the codes of the government and the media.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://lucas-bms.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/16/mockup.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2210\" height=\"1244\"></figure>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Projecting, debating and imagining in order to innovate</strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">This frictional narrative is the opening to workshops for debate between citizens. Thus, we propose tools to accompany the workshops to bring the debate to life, bring out issues and accompany public policies. A workshop allows everyone to debate through an imaginary future.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--wide\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://lucas-bms.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/16/1-solution-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2291\" height=\"595\"></figure>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><strong>Methodology</strong></h3>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://lucas-bms.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/16/process-vga-en.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1142\" height=\"220\"></figure>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\"  data-is-empty=\"false\" data-columns=\"2\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://lucas-bms.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/16/gallery/IMG_20180920_105053.jpg\" data-size=\"4032x3024\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://lucas-bms.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/16/gallery/IMG_20180920_105053-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"576\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://lucas-bms.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/16/gallery/IMG-4375.JPG\" data-size=\"4032x3024\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://lucas-bms.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/16/gallery/IMG-4375-thumbnail.JPG\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"576\"></a></figure>\n</div></div>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 class=\"align-center\"><strong><span style=\"color: #fc9561;\">1.

The needs of the inhabitants are decentralised, so they have to travel long distances to get from point A to point B, which necessarily involves heavy car use. Despite the four fixed transport lines and a transport on demand service for the villages around the city centres and bicycle hire, public transport is little used.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://lucas-bms.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/16/3-vga-chiffre-voiture-3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1555\" height=\"602\"></figure>\n<h6>Map of public transport</h6>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\" ><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://lucas-bms.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/16/map-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1774\" height=\"1811\">\n<figcaption >Visualisation of existing and future transport in the Val de Garonne linking the villages (relay town) to the central centres (Marmande and Tonneins).</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p class=\"p3\">We have mapped all the actors and the interactions between them through a systemic representation of the project in order to identify all the stakeholders and to have a clear vision of the roles of each one and the complex relationships between them.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://lucas-bms.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/16/A_actormap-photo.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"3966\" height=\"2315\"></figure>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><strong>Ethnographic research</strong></h3>\n<p class=\"p1\">After a meeting with the elected representatives of the Val des Garonne conurbation for the project brief and to set the objectives, our team went to the field to begin with a user research and immersion phase in order to confront a certain experience of the users. We started in Marmande, the most important city of the VGA.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Using a grid of questions, we also interviewed residents of Marmande and the surrounding area: public transport users, bus drivers, local residents and motorists. The aim of these interviews was to identify transport habits, knowledge of public transport and the needs of users. We took public transport in order to see how a journey from the centre of Marmande to the outskirts (factories and dwellings) goes.</p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\"  data-is-empty=\"false\" data-columns=\"2\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://lucas-bms.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/16/gallery/photo-arrete-de-bus.jpg\" data-size=\"3024x4032\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://lucas-bms.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/16/gallery/photo-arrete-de-bus-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://lucas-bms.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/16/gallery/P_20180924_144144.jpg\" data-size=\"3120x4160\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://lucas-bms.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/16/gallery/P_20180924_144144-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\"></a></figure>\n</div></div>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><strong>Research analysis</strong></h3>\n<p class=\"p2\">On the basis of this study and the observations, we have broken down the main users into several groups: firstly car users and secondly public transport users (workers, high school and college students, and the elderly). We detailed their profiles according to their objectives, expectations, motivations, fears and digital skills. We were able to develop a visualisation of the user experience. Thanks to this, we visualised the needs and objectives of users during their use of a service, noting the negative and positive emotions of these interactions. The important points of the needs and pains of the experience were useful to us in the ideation phase.</p>\n<p>The verbatims of the users were sorted by subject (car, public transport, bicycle...) and by positive or negative opinion, showing public transport malfunctions, including delays, forgotten passengers or a bus stop missed by the driver.</p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\"  data-is-empty=\"false\" data-columns=\"2\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://lucas-bms.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/16/gallery/photo-verbatim-1.jpg\" data-size=\"3120x4160\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://lucas-bms.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/16/gallery/photo-verbatim-1-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"1024\"></a>\n<figcaption>Sorts verbatims by type and positive/negative.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://lucas-bms.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/16/gallery/photo-verbatim-2.jpg\" data-size=\"600x800\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://lucas-bms.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/16/gallery/photo-verbatim-2-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"800\"></a></figure>\n</div></div>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><strong>Understanding the needs of users</strong></h3>\n<p class=\"p2\">Our analysis and field observation led us to several observations:</p>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li3\">a lack of information on available transport;</li>\n<li class=\"li3\">difficulty in booking and access to stops (adaptability according to the young or senior user);</li>\n<li class=\"li3\">lack of mobility services - not flexible and not fluid ;</li>\n<li class=\"li3\">certain types of mobility are not used due to lack of information and fear / prejudice (carpooling);</li>\n<li class=\"li3\">lack of awareness of tomorrow's mobility, collective and individual interest in using public transport to promote intermodality.</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"p2\">This analysis identifies essential needs, such as: clear information on existing mobility services, access to fluid and flexible mobility services (for registration and reservation before the bus journey). We note that physical accessibility to transport networks is difficult, especially if the person does not have a bus stop in his or her municipality or if the stop is far away, and if the frequency of timetables is limited. Connections are numerous and intermodality is a brake on smooth travel.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://lucas-bms.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/16/4-besoins.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1303\" height=\"620\"></figure>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><strong>Targeting users</strong></h3>\n<p class=\"p2\">As a result of these analyses, we have identified the following types of potential users: residents working fixed hours for residential and business travel. Those who make this type of regular journey are employees, blue-collar workers and schoolchildren.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://lucas-bms.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/16/5-cibles.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1462\" height=\"620\"></figure>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><strong>Course analysis </strong></h3>\n<p class=\"p2\">In order to visualise the experience of the users, we have created user itineraries based on data collected in the field. Also, in order to find the root of the problems, we used the 5 whys method to find the problems related to the public transport offers and to find the deep needs.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\" ><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://lucas-bms.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/16/C-5_why.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1063\" height=\"579\">\n<figcaption >\"5 why's\" method.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h5><strong>Journey car</strong></h5>\n<p class=\"p1\">The car is the most flexible means of transport compared to public transport. However, by analysing the economy of cities, we observe deserted city centres, the main shops are located in commercial areas on the outskirts and that services (work, health) are scattered in the municipalities of the VGA. They are therefore more suitable and accessible by car.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://lucas-bms.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/16/persona-1-julie.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1347\" height=\"887\"></figure>\n<h5 class=\"p1\"><strong>Public transport users</strong></h5>\n<p class=\"p1\">For commuting or occasional journeys, public transport user routes are less flexible than car travel, as there is less frequency, few stops outside villages, forcing people to take bicycles or walk for example. There is also less intercommunal connection requiring you to go through Marmande if you want to go to other villages. In addition, the fluidity of the route is slowed down by the complexity of registrations and reservations for buses on demand (you have to plan, call to book) and logistical problems cause delays and problems with connections. Finally, there are few mobility services offered in relation to the daily travel needs of the inhabitants, both in terms of public transport, but also in terms of planning: there are few park-and-ride facilities, few or no dedicated cycle routes.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The journey of public transport users is divided into three phases: beforehand in order to prepare for the journey, on the day when the journey takes place and afterwards. The \"painful\" moments are shown in red on the user route sketches below.</p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\"  data-is-empty=\"false\" data-columns=\"2\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://lucas-bms.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/16/gallery/persona-2-marcus.jpg\" data-size=\"1338x871\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://lucas-bms.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/16/gallery/persona-2-marcus-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"500\"></a>\n<figcaption>Persona for commuting: employee working in Bordeaux</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://lucas-bms.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/16/gallery/parcours-1-2.jpg\" data-size=\"1507x1055\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://lucas-bms.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/16/gallery/parcours-1-2-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"538\"></a>\n<figcaption>User journey tilting route</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://lucas-bms.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/16/gallery/persona-3-martin.jpg\" data-size=\"1347x917\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://lucas-bms.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/16/gallery/persona-3-martin-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"523\"></a>\n<figcaption>Persona for commuting: student at the high school in Tonneins</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://lucas-bms.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/16/gallery/parcours-2-2.jpg\" data-size=\"1515x1038\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://lucas-bms.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/16/gallery/parcours-2-2-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"526\"></a>\n<figcaption>User journey tilting route</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://lucas-bms.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/16/gallery/persona-4-henriette.jpg\" data-size=\"1347x886\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://lucas-bms.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/16/gallery/persona-4-henriette-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"505\"></a>\n<figcaption>Persona occasional trip: senior going to Marmande</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://lucas-bms.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/16/gallery/parcours-3-2.jpg\" data-size=\"1619x1057\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://lucas-bms.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/16/gallery/parcours-3-2-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"501\"></a>\n<figcaption>User journey occasional trip</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div></div>\n<h6> Emotional map </h6>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--wide\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://lucas-bms.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/16/6-parcours-4-analyse.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2383\" height=\"1532\"></figure>\n<h6>Problems on the user route</h6>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--wide\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://lucas-bms.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/16/7-parcours-5-liste-probleme-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2394\" height=\"1344\"></figure>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><strong>Car VS public transport</strong></h3>\n<p>To shed light on our research phase, we compared the available modes of transport in order to identify the advantages and constraints of each:</p>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li2\">Is it available in the entire VGA?</li>\n<li class=\"li2\">How long is the waiting time?</li>\n<li class=\"li2\">What is the frequency?</li>\n<li class=\"li2\">What is the price?</li>\n<li class=\"li2\">What is its impact on the environment?</li>\n</ul>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://lucas-bms.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/16/analyse-des-services-de-mobilite.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"2294\" height=\"1298\"></figure>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://lucas-bms.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/16/8-pacours-vs.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1419\" height=\"620\"></figure>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><strong>Issue</strong></h3>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>How can we think of a sustainable and flexible transport service offer taking into account the rural environment in the Val de Garonne in order to limit the use of the private car?</strong></p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 class=\"align-center\"><strong><span style=\"color: #fc9561;\">2.

To this end, we have devised a collaborative transport service based on car-sharing, for free and rewarding communal and inter-communal transport in the Val de Garonne Agglomeration, with meeting points set aside for this purpose.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">The car-sharing service would operate free of charge by paying users in local currency created for this purpose. The currency could then be used in certain VGA shops and services. However, the driver would not be remunerated on the costs of using his journey, making the daily journey we propose to provide a rewarding benefit. In addition, this new service offer provides an intermediary to the private car to facilitate inter-municipal transport and interconnection with shuttle mobility services (PEM - relay towns). We have presented this hypothesis in the form of usage scenarios.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://lucas-bms.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/16/piste-2-1-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"298\" height=\"170\"></figure>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://lucas-bms.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/16/piste-2-1.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1542\" height=\"990\"></figure>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://lucas-bms.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/16/piste-2-3-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1685\" height=\"916\"></figure>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://lucas-bms.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/16/piste-2-4.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1614\" height=\"780\"></figure>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><strong>Track 3: Cross-cutting reflection</strong></h3>\n<p class=\"p1\">In addition to these two tracks, we proposed a transversal reflection on the evolution of mobility in rural areas identified in the inspiration phase. We imagined possible future modes of transport through the construction of design fiction. Using design fiction allows us to establish a context that engages debate and reflection in order to raise awareness of the uses of the car.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://lucas-bms.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/16/piste-transversale.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1505\" height=\"830\"></figure>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 class=\"align-center\"><strong><span style=\"color: #fc9561;\">3. Co-build the futur</span></strong></h2>\n<p> </p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><strong>Transversal exploration</strong></h3>\n<p class=\"p1\">The VGA team has chosen to set off on track three and explore a future through design fiction. We designed our proposal in two stages:</p>\n<ol class=\"ol1\">\n<li class=\"li2\"><strong>the conception of design fiction at first, </strong>which introduces to an imaginary world through immersion objects ;</li>\n<li class=\"li2\">it allows the introduction to <strong>participative workshops </strong>to debate on mobility and imagine a better present with the inhabitants, elected representatives and stakeholders.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><strong>What is design fiction?</strong></h3>\n<p class=\"p2\"><strong>What? </strong>Design fiction is a branch of design that creates <strong>projects </strong>made to anticipate plausible, probable, desirable, preferable futures... We imagine the future through fiction in order to re-interrogate the present through projection, \"what <strong>if.</strong>.. it was like this... what would happen? \" through a <strong>narrative</strong>.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><strong>Why? </strong>Design fiction probes our beliefs and values, challenges our assumptions and encourages us to imagine how what we call 'reality' might be different. Projection allows us to create debates around today's issues in order to make better decisions.</p>\n<p class=\"p2\"><strong>How? </strong>It is about creating a context, a fictional story around a narrative in which our users/audience can project themselves with the help of a tangible universe and an object that creates a world. It is in the projection into this fictional world that we can debate using the elements of this world as a support.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://lucas-bms.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/16/fiction-1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1991\" height=\"806\"></figure>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><strong>Looking to the future</strong></h3>\n<p class=\"align-center\"><span style=\"color: #fc9561;\"><strong>What if you can no longer drive alone?</strong></span></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Our fictional world imagines mobility with the ideal means of transport for the inhabitants of the VGA: the car. To make this viable, a law requires carpooling at certain times of the day to raise awareness of the car for several people. Based on the air-label sticker, a sticker must be affixed to the windscreen to show how many people must be in the car at certain times. Depending on the car, you should drive with one, two or three passengers in your car.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">We choose to talk about the private car because there is a strong dependence of the inhabitants for this type of transport. We have imagined a possible, probable future, but it may not be preferable or even perfect, but it allows us to be the basis for reflection.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\" ><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://lucas-bms.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/16/explication-fiction.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"1464\" height=\"639\">\n<figcaption >Explication de la vignette.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><strong>Fictional objects</strong></h3>\n<p class=\"p1\">We have designed fictitious communication objects in order to immerse the citizen into fiction and create a junction point that connects him to reality. By taking up the communication codes of the government and the media it uses, we anchor fiction in a daily life familiar to the citizen.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">These fictional objects would be presented in the streets of the city to invite debate in certain areas of the institution as well as during the workshop. Flyers and the website are means used by the Ministry to convey a message. The conventional graphic style supports this connection to reality.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\" ><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://lucas-bms.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/16/mockup-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2210\" height=\"1244\">\n<figcaption >\n<div class=\"page\" title=\"Page 26\">\n<div class=\"section\">\n<div class=\"layoutArea\">\n<div class=\"column\">\n<p>Each fiction device is meticulously chosen.

The architecture of the information is worked according to the social network format and this communication reaches a wide audience. It allows us to target young, educated citizens who use other media to keep up to date with current events. They are not the only ones targeted, but they are part of our target audience of fixed time travel.</p>\n<div class=\"post__iframe\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/UoD2nug4mdc\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div>\n<p class=\"p1\">To immerse the spectators in addition to the video, we presented a website where users can simulate their Ecovoit<span class=\"s1\">' </span>card in order to establish the serious and preventive image of the government.</p>\n<div class=\"post__iframe\"><iframe loading=\"lazy\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/b-22rFtHWkQ\" frameborder=\"0\" allow=\"accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture\" allowfullscreen=\"allowfullscreen\"></iframe></div>\n<p class=\"p1\">This video and this site are objects of diegesis that invite us to believe in a fiction where we envisage the future. They are not intended to be applicable or saleable products, they are prototypes of design fiction that aim to question.</p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><strong>The workshop to design with users</strong></h3>\n<p class=\"p2\">Design fiction proposes a story that questions our daily lives and our needs in the first part to debate a possible future. It is thanks to these reactions that we can then find the stakes, the precise issues and create around the workshop.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--wide\" ><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://lucas-bms.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/16/fiction-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1489\" height=\"760\">\n<figcaption >Design fiction process.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--wide\" ><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://lucas-bms.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/16/1-solution-3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"2291\" height=\"595\">\n<figcaption >Workshop process.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p class=\"p1\">We have designed the workshops and the tools to work on them: a tool for finding the root of the problem, sharing experience, decision-making... The workshop is divided into different phases:</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"li1\"><strong>Phase 1: </strong>Identifying themes</li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><strong>Phase 2: </strong>Finding the problem</li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><strong>Phase 3: </strong>Visualising the problem </li>\n<li class=\"li1\"><strong>Phase 4: </strong>Pitching, restoring the problems</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"p1\">Subsequently, the workshops could be broken down into different phases, going as far as imagining and prototyping concrete solutions. With the workshops, we create a space and time to have feedback from citizens and informed discussions with elected officials in order to lead to other types of solutions. They will allow elected officials to take into consideration needs and make appropriate choices.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://lucas-bms.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/16/fiction-3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"1431\" height=\"830\"></figure>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><strong>The gains</strong></h3>\n<p class=\"p1\">Design fiction enables the <strong>foundations to be laid for a real problem, to explore in depth the possibilities for action, </strong>to raise awareness of mobility and to engage in a process of empathy with the community. As noted, citizens have a strong need for mobility by car. It is necessary to raise awareness of practices to invest in new uses of mobility, whether by reviewing the use of the shuttle and public transport (lane 1) or with free carpooling (lane 2).</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 class=\"align-center\"><strong><span style=\"color: #fc9561;\">Conclusion</span></strong></h2>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Field observation has enabled us to bring out existing problems in terms of mobility, which design fiction allows us to re-interview through the narrative. Even if it seems redundant, it seemed essential to us to be able to start again on a phase of exploration and ideation in cooperation and to question the issues and objectives with all the stakeholders. This iteration then allows us to offer a service that takes into account deeper systemic issues. But the workshop could not take place. Digital technology can revolutionise mobility practices, but scaling up from cities to countryside works with different complexities. I think that design makes it possible, through modelling and visualisation, to accompany this kind of problem and to implement strong solutions. Finally, this project has reinforced my idea of the importance of finding the WHY of the problem and the how afterwards, hence our interest in design fiction. Finally, the user journey map is a tool that I find extremely useful, allowing me to find the problems and also a support for cooperation with stakeholders.</p>",

It is set up by the Métropole de Lyon with public and private partners. The Trabool site is used by users to order and recharge their cards and subscriptions from home, using a charger included in the kit.</p>\n<p>As this service was deployed when I arrived in the Metropolis, I followed it for 12 months through several missions in parallel (graphics, user testing of the application, etc). I present one of the projects here.</p>\n<h3><strong>Problem</strong></h3>\n<p class=\"p1\">As Trabool has evolved, new technical features have been added to the website to improve it: adding accounts, managing multiple accounts and subscriptions, ordering or renewing a card and many more. But some of these aspects blocked the user's journey through the site by the information architecture and layout. Led by the project manager, our team worked on redesigning the website and user journeys in order to integrate changes.</p>\n<h3><strong>Solution</strong></h3>\n<p class=\"p1\">After several iterations and user tests, we have designed new interfaces for the registration process, the subscription and the management of personal information.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>With Trabool, have only one card for your travels</strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">One place to order, subscribe to services and manage subscriptions for you and your loved ones.</p>\n<h5><figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://lucas-bms.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/14/accueil.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"450\" height=\"600\"></figure></h5>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Simple management shared with your family and friends</strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Simply add all the members of your family.

My role in this project was that of service designer and ux, in a team composed of two project managers, a social psychologist and a UX designer, in collaboration with the team in charge of the website development (Sopra Steria) and a business analyst. Working as a team with Valentin and Alexandra, we decided together on the approach to be followed, alternating phases of work in co-design and alone.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 class=\"align-center\"><span style=\"color: #fc9561;\"><strong>1. Research</strong></span></h2>\n<p> </p>\n<h3>Stat of play</h3>\n<p class=\"p1\">The project benefits from an experimentation phase led by Valentin Labit, a social psychologist, that is voluntary users known as \"pioneers\" test services before they are set up for the general public. They answer questionnaires and are mobilised for workshops. His expertise throughout the project and the information he has been collecting for several months has enabled us to understand the behaviour and emotions of users, identify problems and define their needs.</p>\n<h3>Defining the target</h3>\n<p class=\"p1\">Trabool is a public service and is open to all inhabitants of the metropolis. The public of the Trabool service is all inhabitants from the age of 18. Currently, users are men and women between 40 and 60 years old, family and executive users who need to combine subscriptions and manage those of their relatives. Some services are still accessible to a particular target group.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image\" ><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://lucas-bms.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/14/test-utilisateur.jpg\" alt=\"présentation-test\" width=\"4160\" height=\"3120\">\n<figcaption >Test session with technical experts for the future mobile application.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h3><strong>Understanding the difficulties</strong></h3>\n<p class=\"p1\">As a result of its workshops and questionnaires, we were able to analyse that there were problems of understanding of the Trabool service on the part of the users as well as problems for :</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"li1\">ordering a card, viewing and navigating the available offers;</li>\n<li class=\"li1\">renewing a lost card;</li>\n<li class=\"li1\">transferring a partner subscription.</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"p1\">Many of the problems were due to the layout of the information, the prioritization of the information which caused a lack of clarity in the service and the use of the website.</p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\"  data-is-empty=\"false\" data-columns=\"2\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://lucas-bms.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/14/gallery/probleme-commande-2.png\" data-size=\"700x1242\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://lucas-bms.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/14/gallery/probleme-commande-2-thumbnail.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"700\" height=\"1242\"></a>\n<figcaption>Responsive problem</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://lucas-bms.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/14/gallery/Capture-decran-2020-10-12-a-10.51.33.png\" data-size=\"694x1193\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://lucas-bms.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/14/gallery/Capture-decran-2020-10-12-a-10.51.33-thumbnail.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"694\" height=\"1193\"></a>\n<figcaption>Responsive problem</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div></div>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\"  data-is-empty=\"false\" data-columns=\"2\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://lucas-bms.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/14/gallery/Capture-decran-2020-10-12-a-10.53.41.png\" data-size=\"1326x942\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://lucas-bms.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/14/gallery/Capture-decran-2020-10-12-a-10.53.41-thumbnail.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"546\"></a>\n<figcaption>Error message not visible.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://lucas-bms.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/14/gallery/probleme-2.png\" data-size=\"1361x618\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://lucas-bms.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/14/gallery/probleme-2-thumbnail.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"349\"></a>\n<figcaption>Error message arrives at the end of the order process.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://lucas-bms.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/14/gallery/abonnement-probleme-2.png\" data-size=\"2547x1427\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://lucas-bms.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/14/gallery/abonnement-probleme-2-thumbnail.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"430\"></a>\n<figcaption>Subscription information not visible.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div></div>\n<h3><strong>Define design goals</strong></h3>\n<p class=\"p1\">During brainstorming, our team determined the main objectives of the roadmap according to the future stages of the project. We came to dedicate ourselves to facilitating the ordering of a card, the management of subscriptions, personal information and the overall organisation of the site.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">For this mission, my resource was:</p>\n<ul>\n<li class=\"li1\">propose new, clearer and more intuitive user journeys;</li>\n<li class=\"li1\">reorganise the existing functionalities;</li>\n<li class=\"li1\">complete the graphic charter.</li>\n</ul>\n<p class=\"p1\">But in addition to the website, we worked on clarifying the value proposition of Trabool. I believe that a clear and strong service proposition is more likely to create engaging services. This would increase the subscription to services for recurring use. Most users use the service to renew their subscriptions, but do not subscribe to additional services.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">We have also established a business model canvas of the current status of the project, identifying the value propositions and targets of the project. You can find this project in the following Sprint Design page.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 class=\"align-center\"><span style=\"color: #fc9561;\"><strong>2. Redesign process</strong></span></h2>\n<p> </p>\n<h3>Inspiration</h3>\n<p class=\"p1\">Examining application dashboards that allow the management of several accounts at the same time, we were able to draw out the key points of their success:</p>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li2\">structured navigation identification of information relating to each account</li>\n<li class=\"li2\">presentation of offers and action button</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><strong>Building the page structure</strong></h3>\n<p class=\"p2\">Thanks to our observations and the analysis of technical bugs provided by the business analyst, we were able to start imagining user journey solutions. Our ideation phase started with quick interface sketches. Sketch sessions allow us to quickly project ideas once problems were identified and iterated quickly. We then modified the user journeys and made wireframes for initial results. We tried to represent a new information architecture of the pages.</p>\n<p><strong>Order a Trabool card</strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">A more direct way to create an account or to connect via Grand Lyon Connect (the Metropolis' authentication platform) to order your card.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\" ><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://lucas-bms.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/14/1_sketch-commander-3.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"533\">\n<figcaption >Sketch of the registration route. Session of 1h 45 sketch.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p class=\"p1\"> </p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Manage your account</strong></p>\n<p>Offers are managed on a single interface, with information relating to each subscription and the possibility of renewing them. It gives access to the different subscriptions of his \"Tribe\"  composed of his relatives. The term \"Tribe\" (Tribu in french) made us wonder if users understood it. It was used before, but after the tests we came back to a simpler term. We had imagined the change of account in order to manage the information of each account, but this added steps in the journey which was not used at the moment.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\" ><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://lucas-bms.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/14/2_sketch-gerer.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"533\">\n<figcaption >\n<p class=\"p3\">Search Sketch for account management.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\" ></figure>\n</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p> </p>\n<p class=\"p1\"><strong>The offers</strong></p>\n<p class=\"p1\">We have worked on a simplified visualization of the offers. In this version, we wanted users to be able to see the offers by type and novelties.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\" ><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://lucas-bms.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/14/3_sketch-offre.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"533\">\n<figcaption >Research sketch for the visualization of offers.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<p class=\"p3\">Research sketch for viewing offers.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\" ></figure>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><strong>Wireframes</strong></h3>\n<p class=\"p2\">The Véléda board representation quickly brought us solutions for the presentation and management of several accounts. I quickly built a few basic screens to get feedback from the team and users on the structure and organization of the pages, which led to the establishment of a hierarchical visualization and standard layout for future components of the site. </p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\"  data-is-empty=\"false\" data-columns=\"2\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://lucas-bms.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/14/gallery/Wireframes_Accueil.jpg\" data-size=\"4001x3992\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://lucas-bms.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/14/gallery/Wireframes_Accueil-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"wireframe-accueil\" width=\"768\" height=\"766\"></a>\n<figcaption>Wireframe of the home page</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://lucas-bms.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/14/gallery/Wireframes_Decouvrir_les_services.jpg\" data-size=\"4001x6259\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://lucas-bms.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/14/gallery/Wireframes_Decouvrir_les_services-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"wireframe-offre\" width=\"768\" height=\"1201\"></a>\n<figcaption>Structure of the offers</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://lucas-bms.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/14/gallery/Wireframes_Commander_un_pass_etape1.jpg\" data-size=\"4001x2601\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://lucas-bms.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/14/gallery/Wireframes_Commander_un_pass_etape1-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"wireframe-commande\" width=\"768\" height=\"499\"></a>\n<figcaption>Wireframe of the card order</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://lucas-bms.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/14/gallery/4-Wireframes_Commander_un_pass-_choix.jpg\" data-size=\"4001x2253\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://lucas-bms.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/14/gallery/4-Wireframes_Commander_un_pass-_choix-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"432\"></a>\n<figcaption>Wireframe when ordering</figcaption>\n</figure>\n</div></div>\n<p class=\"p1\">The current use of the site is geared towards computer users, because to renew subscriptions you have to connect your card to a box once ordered. But to improve usage on smartphones, the most penalising moment is the synchronisation phase between the card and the computer.</p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><strong>User flow</strong></h3>\n<p class=\"p2\">We noticed that the connection phase could be problematic, as it required the change of site and then reconnection to Trabool. Integrating it would make the route more fluid during connection and registration, but the technique used did not allow this to be done. The use of paper and manual interaction allows a first approach to the user experience.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\" ><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://lucas-bms.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/14/architecture-information.png\" alt=\"architecture-information\" width=\"700\" height=\"459\">\n<figcaption >User flow.</figcaption>\n</figure>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><strong>Interfaces low-fidelity</strong></h3>\n<p class=\"p1\">Once the wireframe screens had been finalised without colour, we were able to move on to the test phase.</p>\n<div class=\"gallery-wrapper\"><div class=\"gallery\"  data-is-empty=\"false\" data-columns=\"2\">\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://lucas-bms.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/14/gallery/accueil.jpg\" data-size=\"1920x2199\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://lucas-bms.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/14/gallery/accueil-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"880\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://lucas-bms.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/14/gallery/les-offres.jpg\" data-size=\"1920x2348\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://lucas-bms.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/14/gallery/les-offres-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"939\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://lucas-bms.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/14/gallery/ma-tribu.jpg\" data-size=\"1920x1339\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://lucas-bms.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/14/gallery/ma-tribu-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"536\"></a></figure>\n<figure class=\"gallery__item\"><a href=\"https://lucas-bms.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/14/gallery/Commander-un-pass.jpg\" data-size=\"1920x1400\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://lucas-bms.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/14/gallery/Commander-un-pass-thumbnail.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"768\" height=\"560\"></a></figure>\n</div></div>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 class=\"align-center\"><span style=\"color: #fc9561;\"><strong>3. Evaluation</strong></span></h2>\n<p> </p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><strong>Prepare user tests</strong></h3>\n<p class=\"p1\">Testing is the best way to evaluate the user experience. We have conducted usability tests with users to validate new designs that address problems. Testing on a loyalty-based interface will also allow us to understand how users navigate, interact with the site and perceive the service. Several volunteer testers were chosen for the tests, which took place in an individual room, via a laptop with video and audio recording.</p>\n<h3 class=\"p2\"><strong>Protocol &amp; objectives</strong></h3>\n<p class=\"p1\">The objectives were to validate the user experience and our design assumptions before going into production by evaluating the overall system, ergonomics, usability and general understanding of the Trabool service. To do this, I designed a test protocol based on usage scenarios to measure the tasks performed for the routes and functionalities using an observation grid. The scenarios are used to validate or not functionalities and user journey such as:</p>\n<ul class=\"ul1\">\n<li class=\"li3\">The creation of Grand Lyon Connect and Trabool accounts;</li>\n<li class=\"li3\">The order of a card for yourself, for my family;</li>\n<li class=\"li3\">Subscribing to an offer;</li>\n<li class=\"li3\">Management of the offers subscribed in my subscriptions;</li>\n<li class=\"li3\">Understanding of <span class=\"s1\">\"</span>Tribe\" and service in general.</li>\n</ul>\n<h3 class=\"p2\">Perform the tests</h3>\n<p class=\"p1\">During the test, we observe and take notes on how the testers interact with the site, how it navigates, what they say.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--center\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://lucas-bms.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/14/user-test-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"360\" height=\"363\"></figure>\n<p class=\"p1\">The tests are followed by an interview and end with the SUS (System Usability Scale) questionnaire measuring usability and site experience in order to identify the value of our website.</p>\n<p class=\"msg msg--highlight \">\"Usability is a <strong>quality attribute</strong> that assesses how easy user interfaces are to use.\" source : nngroup.com</p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><strong>Understanding the Trabool service</strong></h3>\n<p class=\"p2\">During the first tests, the testers had difficulties understanding the Trabool service and its ecosystem: a website to subscribe and a card used and how it works. Others did not know where to look for information about Trabool and the project leaders. Descriptions are not understandable and long presentation texts are rarely read. For the presentation of offers, explanations are missing and the reading is not visible, which can result in a negative experience because it is not understandable.</p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><strong>Order a Trabool card</strong></h3>\n<p class=\"p2\">When ordering a card, the subscription transfer is not included, as users are wondering if there will be redundancy in the transportation cards. We have also noticed a misunderstanding of the wording when ordering the Trabool card such as \"Tribe\" or \"Activate transport function\". Once the card has been received, it allows you to subscribe to public transport. During the tests, 1 out of 4 users did not activate it. Finally, when a new user creates an account, the switching to the Grand Lyon Connect connection site is not understood, and raises the issue of the overall consistency of Metropolitan services.</p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><strong>User feedback</strong></h3>\n<p class=\"p2\">The tests allowed us to build on the negative points of the site's course in order to improve them and to make hypotheses on the next steps of the design. Certain aspects that we did not fear, such as when ordering a card, were not understood on the whole and allowed us to take a step back to improve the interfaces. The simplest elements are the management and ordering of offers. But overall, the value of the service provided for users is not very clear and does not seem to meet their expectations.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<h2 class=\"align-center\"><span style=\"color: #fc9561;\"><strong>4. Final Design</strong></span></h2>\n<p> </p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><strong>High-fidelity integration</strong></h3>\n<p class=\"p1\">After a phase of iterations on the high-fidelity interfaces, we designed a final version of the interfaces. The final version of the interfaces was re-tested in order to validate our final interfaces. We had to limit our ideas to the technical possibilities and the demand. In one version, I would have liked to integrate a map of cultural and sports venues in combination with mobility possibilities and open routes. The improvements reorganize the pages, making the user journey more fluid and integrating the management of several accounts. We have integrated a sorting by type of domain of the offers and a section dedicated to the new services for a simple display, a graphic coherence to keep, an account and subscription management and the responsive.</p>\n<p class=\"p1\">Overall in the final version, users find themselves in the paths, the creation of the account and the addition and management of several accounts makes the understanding of the service as a whole and for new users clearer.</p>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--wide\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://lucas-bms.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/14/background-ordi-2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"3050\" height=\"1576\"></figure>\n<figure class=\"post__image post__image--wide\"><img loading=\"lazy\"  src=\"https://lucas-bms.github.io/gh-pages/media/posts/14/background-smartphone.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"3620\" height=\"2044\"></figure>\n<p>This redesign of the interfaces and user experience allowed us to start the new evolutions present on the roadmap, by adding a ticketing system. This would add an accentuated use of the map and the application to come.</p>\n<h3 class=\"p1\"><strong>Sharing of advances</strong></h3>\n<p class=\"p1\">We designed the high-fidelity mock-up on Figma so that all team members as well as front-end developers can access it and allow them to inspect the file and export the CSS components. The development was followed up with the business analyst, and via a ticket tracking table to ensure that the implementation was aligned with the interfaces we designed.</p>",
